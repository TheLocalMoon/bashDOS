# bashDOS
very cool simulated DOS, written in just Bash language with cool things like *custom coloring using HEX color system*, built-in calculator (just like in Python interpreter!) and much more!

## Features
- customization using HEX color system
- calculator
- epic `say` command

*ps.: the reason that theres like 0 features is because this is the first version (aka. 0.1), so don't expect much from it*

## Plugins
bashDOS also supports plugins, so you can add your own commands to it. the example of creating a plugin is in the file that located in `plugins/example.sh`. to know more things about creating plugins for bashDOS, take a look at the file `dep_plg.sh` (deploy plugin), it has features i dont even know what they do because chatGPT wrote them :trol:
